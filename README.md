Lunar Birthday Calendar Generator (https://lunar-birthday-calendar-web.firebaseapp.com)

Google Calendar/Outlook does not allow you to create recurring events based on lunar calendar (e.g. Grandma/Grandpa's birthdays.)

This little tool generates an ICS calendar file for you. You can then import the generated ICS file into Google Calendar/Outlook so it's easy to remember when to call/visit them on their birthdays ðŸŽ‚

[This is a webified-version of bluishoul's nice utility]
